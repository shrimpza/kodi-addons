# Kodi Launcher Scripts

Scripts for launching:

- Firefox (Kodi remains running)
- Steam (Terminates Kodi, starts PulseAudio, runs Big Picture, terminates PulseAudio, restarts Kodi)


For zipping files appropriate for installation, disable compression:

`zip -r -0 script.launcher.steam.zip script.launcher.steam/`
